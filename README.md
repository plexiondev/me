# next

**next** ([plexion.dev/next](https://plexion.dev/next)) is a lightweight, simple branch from plexion.dev - being hosted on the same domain. it's main purpose for now is to act as a un-obtrusive and simple host for my socials, bio and some of my projects.

it will also hook in with your system and detect what colour theme you are running. depending on if it's **light** or **dark**, the correct colour set will be used. try it out:

## why 'next'?

the name is inspired from [osu!next](https://osunext.tumblr.com/) but has no actual meaning besides being a name. it could be changed in the future but if it works there's no point changing it.
